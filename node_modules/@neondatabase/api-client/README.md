# @neondatabase/api-client

## Introduction

The `@neondatabase/api-client` library is a wrapper for the Neon API. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Neon API using TypeScript.

## Installation

To install the library, you can use npm or yarn. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

or

```bash
yarn add @neondatabase/api-client
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the `@neondatabase/api-client` library, follow these steps:

1. Get your api key:

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys
1. Click "Generate new API key"
1. Enter name for your key and press "Create"
1. Preserve your api key somewhere, so you can pass it down to your code

2. Import the library:

```typescript
import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';
```

3. Create an instance of the API client by calling the `createApiClient` function:

```typescript
const apiClient = createApiClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

4. Use the `apiClient` instance to make API calls. For example:

```typescript
const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
console.log(response);
```
